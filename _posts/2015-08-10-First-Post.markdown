This is my very first post written in Markdown. Markdown is a really cool language because it allows you to write in plain text and then runs the text through a processor aferwards. 

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var length = [1,2,3];
for(var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    console.log(length[i]);
}

{% endhighlight%}
